# NeuralFields
The mathematical model is described in the attached articles
No direct matrix in data folder
It can be calculated from the available data on the surface of the cortex and its shells, as well as from the position of the sensors.
Optional: all data with examples can be found in the article Verkhlyutov V., Burlakov E. MEG simulations using local propagation of traveling waves calculated using neural field equations. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7520054
